This midterm project was completed during the Spring 2024 Semester for DS740: Data Mining during my Master's of Science in Data Science at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay
Files include the dataset in .CSV form, two ".RMD" files with project code, and the final paper as a ".PDF"


BRIEF OVERVIEW:
- A thorough Exploratory Data Analysis into potentially significant predictors of sports groups was performed
- Feature Engineering was performed to make the data usable by the models
- KNN Classification and Random Forest Models were assessed based on the accuracy metric
- Single and Double Cross Validation were utilized for hyperparameter tuning and honest model assessment 
- Random Forest with mtry = 1 achieved the best performance with an accuracy of 71.22%
